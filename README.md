# stata_templates_ado
Repository for standard templates for Stata .do and .ado files for sociological research (or social-oriented statistics more generally).

Many of these are my tweaks based on the recommendations from the book
[The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata](http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/web_workflow/wf_home.htm)
by J. Scott Long.
